## 💡 What This Repo Represents

This repository is more than just code — it's my hands-on learning journal. Each project reflects a concept I’ve explored and understood through real implementation. The goal wasn’t just to complete assignments, but to truly grasp how C# applications are designed, structured, and connected — from backend logic to user interaction.
